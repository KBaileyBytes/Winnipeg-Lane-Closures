# Wininpeg Lane Closures

This website was made for practice with Bootstrap and using the fetch API.

Some challenges included:
- Ensuring only the newly requested data is displayed.
- Replacing full words with the appropriate abbreviation used in the API. Eg. Road > Rd 

Possible future additions:
- Allowing the user to select what they want to search by.
